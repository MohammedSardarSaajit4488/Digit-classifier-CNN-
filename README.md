# Digit Classifier Using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves a high accuracy of **98%** and demonstrates the power of CNNs compared to traditional machine learning methods.

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of a summer training report to showcase the implementation of a CNN-based digit classifier. The model was trained using **Python** and **TensorFlow**, and is evaluated against the popular **MNIST** dataset.

### Key Features:
- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: For dimensionality reduction.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.
- **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.
- **Comparison**: Performance comparison with Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and k-NN.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling image data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning comparisons.
